            In the context of nutrition, calories refer to the amount of energy
            provided by food or drinks that the body can use to perform its
            functions, such as breathing, pumping blood, and moving muscles. The
            body needs a certain amount of calories every day to function
            properly, and this amount varies based on factors such as age,
            gender, weight, height, and activity level.

            A workout refers to a physical exercise or training session that is
            designed to improve fitness, strength, endurance, or overall health.
            Workouts can take many forms and can include a variety of exercises,
            such as cardiovascular exercises, strength training, stretching, and
            balance exercises. Cardiovascular exercises, also known as aerobic
            exercises, are activities that increase the heart rate and breathing
            rate and are designed to improve cardiovascular fitness. Examples of
            cardiovascular exercises include jogging, cycling, swimming, and
            dancing.

            Muscle growth, also known as muscle hypertrophy, is a process that
            occurs when muscle fibers are damaged and then repaired through
            exercise, specifically strength training exercises. The process of
            muscle growth involves breaking down muscle fibers through exercise,
            providing them with the nutrients and rest they need to recover, and
            then repeating the process with increasing intensity and volume over
            time. Here are some key factors that contribute to muscle growth
            through workout:
